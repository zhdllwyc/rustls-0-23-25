Use this file to document modification on top of rustls for attested TLS interfacing AWS Nitro Enclave
- src
  - client
    - client_conn:
      - func new: create extra_ext based on AttestationMode
    - common
    - hs:
      - start_handshake: sample random client nonce if client request evidence
      - hello.server_sent_unsolicited_extensions: add EvidenceRandom to extension whitelist. When client is proprosal, server will send back a EvidenceRandom in its encrypted extension. We need to add EvidenceRandom into extension whitelist beforehand so that client do not throw error when seeing this extension from the server.
      - add fn validate_server_attestation_extension: validate server encrypted extension based on client AttestationMode: request, proposal, mutual
      - update clientcontext: client_evidence_random
    - tls13:
      - update clientcontext: client_attest, server_attest, server_evidence_random

      - add fn validate_client_attestation_extension: validate client extension based on server AttestationMode: request, proposal, mutual
      - update servercontext
    - tls13
      - document how server extension is encrypted
      - modify emit_certificate_req_tls13 to take in server context
  - msgs
    - enums:
      - add three extension type and give them fake IANA number.
      - add two extension euum for requesting and proposal evidence type, right now each enum only has two variants: [no, aws], but this enum can be extended in the future. 
    - handshake:
      - add extension into client and server extension.
      - add enum AttestationMode
  - common_state: add client_attest, server_attest, client_evidence_random, server_evidence_random to struct CommonState. 
  - error: add six variants to PeerMisbehaved for describing server and client missing extensions. 
  - lib: expose AttestationMode so that depending rust crate can specify attested TLS mode: disabled, request, proposal, mutual.
